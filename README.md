# package-challenge

Determine which things to put into the package that the total weight is less than or equal to the package limit and the total cost is as large as possible. 
Send a package which weights less in case there is more than one package with the same price.

So your signature should look like
```
public static String pack(String filePath) throws APIException
```

### Input sample

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. The input file contains several lines. Each line is one test case.
Each line contains the weight that the package can take (before the colon) and the list of things you need to choose. Each thing is enclosed in parentheses where the 1st number is a thing's index number, the 2nd is its weight and the 3rd is its cost. E.g.

```
81 : (1,53.38,€45) (2,88.62,€98) (3,78.48,€3) (4,72.30,€76) (5,30.18,€9) (6,46.34,€48)
8 : (1,15.3,€34)
75 : (1,85.31,€29) (2,14.55,€74) (3,3.98,€16) (4,26.24,€55) (5,63.69,€52) (6,76.25,€75) (7,60.02,€74) (8,93.18,€35) (9,89.95,€78)
56 : (1,90.72,€13) (2,33.80,€40) (3,43.15,€10) (4,37.97,€16) (5,46.81,€36) (6,48.77,€79) (7,81.80,€45) (8,19.36,€79) (9,6.76,€64)
```

### Output sample

For each set of things that you put into the package provide a list (items’ index numbers are separated by comma). E.g.
```
4
-
2,7 
8,9

```
